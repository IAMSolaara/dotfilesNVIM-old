# Instructions 

To use these NeoVim configs you need to have neovim >=0.5.1 and the following dependencies:
 * `nodejs`
 * `npm`
 * `rustup` and other rust utils for RLS

Then you just have to run `./init.sh` here and the script will automatically install this config for you and install any Vundle plugin
